# Hick-Hyman-Law-Demonstration-HCI

Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the more stimuli or choices users face, the
longer it will take them to make a decision.

GUI Designed to illustrate the Hick Hyman’s Law :

➔ An instruction will appear on the screen and action has to be taken as per the instruction.

➔ There are a total 10 such instructions to be executed sequentially.

## Command to run the program : python3 hick_law.py

A table with execution times along with a plot of the same is displayed to the user after completion
of the experiment.

Observations from the graph :

➔ In the frames displaying more number of circles it took a large amount of time for
instruction execution compared to the ones with less number of circles.

➔ In other words, fewer choices are identified and interpreted faster than that of a large
number of choices.
